--User Interface Popup: Adding a popup.html and popup.js to provide an interface to allow users to:
                        enable/disable the feature
                        monitor downloads 
                        view a list of currently monitored downloads 
                        see a log of resumed attempts

## Done --Retry Logic: Implement a more robust retry mechanism for downloads that repeatedly fail to resume
               (e.g., retry a few times with increasing delays)

--Error Handling

--Notifications: Add chrome.notifications to alert the user when a download is interrupted and successfully resumed, 
                 or if it fails to resume after multiple attempts.
